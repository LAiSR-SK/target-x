This repository introduces Target-X, a novel and fast method for the construction of adversarial targeted images on large-scale datasets that can fool the state-of-the-art image classification neural networks. We evaluate the performance of Target-X using the well-trained image classification neural networks of different architectures and compare it with the well-known T-FGSM and T-UAP targeted attacks. The reported results demonstrate that Target-X can generate targeted adversarial images with the least perturbations on large-scale datasets that can fool the image classification neural networks and significantly outperform the T-FGSM and T-UAP attacks.
